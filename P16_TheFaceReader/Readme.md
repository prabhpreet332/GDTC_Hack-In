# The Face Reader

This project is focussed on using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm to train a model to recognize the face of any person whose face pictures have been clicked to use for the recognition algorithm. To detect faces, a built-in/trained model known as haarcascade models will be used. Following are some methods I have mentioned that will help you to create the project quickly and with proper learning techniques.

1. First create a python program to click a picture of yourself.
2. Then create a python program to click picture of you continuously and show every frame of picture, it will be a live video.
3. Then create a program to get your picture to turn black and white.
4. Then create a program to crop your image.
5. Then create a program to detect your face using haarcascade face model.
6. Then we will finally be somewhat ready to create a face recognition algorithm.

Python libraries/modules you will need:
1. Numpy
2. OpenCV (cv2)
3. Pyttsx3 (if required in our project)

Note:- I will upload any necesary module as per requirement. Feel free to ask anything on gitter. Lets have fun coding and learning together.
