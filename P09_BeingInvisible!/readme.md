# Being Invisible !!

In this project we are going to learn to live stream yourself and then we will learn that how we will bw invisible from that live video by simply using python OpenCV Module. This is our main aim but to get comfortable with python and openCV module we will make some small python codes which will later come in use in your main program too. Following are some programs I have mentioned that will help you to create the project quickly and with proper learning techniques.

1) First create a python program to click a picture of yourself.
2) Then create a python program to click picture of you continuously and show every frame of picture, it will be a live video..
3) Then create a program to crop your image.

Now come to prerequisites to do the above mentioned programs:
1) you can use any OS(win, linux) depending on your choice. I will prefer Redhat v7, incase you don't know how to work with Redhat go with    Windows.
2) you have to install Anaconda in your system. Be ALERT while installing it tick the path related options although it is mentioned their    no to tick them but we have to tick both of the checkbox. Discuss it on gitter if any difficulty you face or any confusion yuo have.
3) Now open command prompt and install OpenCV and Numpy libraries(see the command on google how to install opencv and nunpy).
4) Now you guys are ready to start work on the above mentioned programs.
5) Python version 3 is required get it from here https://www.python.org/downloads/

for reference and help I am posting some of the links which will help you throughout the project
1) for numpy library: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-in-python-set-1-introduction/ this is only set1 reference you can go with all      sets as per your feasibility.
2) for opencv library: https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

Here's the link for the ones who are not in the gitter room to discuss their query

Note:- I will upload any necessary module as per requirement. Feel free to ask anything on gitter.

Happy Coding!!!
