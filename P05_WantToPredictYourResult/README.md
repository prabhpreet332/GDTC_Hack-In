# Want to Predict Your Result?

**This projects aim to make machine learning more accessible and relatable to real life events happening around you. It aims to lay a strong foundation and reason to work in this field. Dedicate your time over it diligently and you will be able to see the results for yourself.**

Layout: We have a rough dataset of pdfs for result. We would be having three pdfs for each semester and we will use them to do the overall analytics. Ex: Using Semester-1, Semester-2 marks to predict marks of Semester-3.

Execution: First we clean the data and then we find some general insights in it. We create some hypthesis to test over it and then we start the actual machine learning. It's a multi-step process with each step equally necessary for the next one.

This projects run in the following parts:

* **Data Cleaning and Arranging into csv Files** (Difficulty Medium - Can be Skipped if first time)
* **Data Analysis using Numpy and Pandas** (Difficulty - Easy to Medium - Cannot be Skipped)
* **Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn** (Difficulty - Easy to Medium - Cannot be Skipped)
* **Machine Learning using Regression and Random Forest** (Difficulty - Medium - Shouldnâ€™t be Skipped)
